        <ul>
          <li>Enter your HTML notes here</li>
          <li>The head element contians information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element contians further elements such as section that have elements or tags such as unordered list, list items</li>
          <li>HTML so far is fun!</li>
          <li>Final note: when I was switching branch in the previous section my index file and assets was deleted so I had to extract another to continue. Hopefully this has not broken anything. Although I am unsure if this code is being placed on the main branch or secondary branch that will be later merged.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>So a few quick notes on my previous errors and troubleshoot/debugging, I was able to do all the things planned in my solution note in HTML section and solved the issue. So now I have four branches and clearly know how to switch and off and on main. Then also PR working code to main branch and so on.</li>
          <li>Learned how to link a css stylesheet to HTML code.</li>
          <li>Learning how to add declarations and then tweak property and value of those declarations in stylesheet.
          </li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your Git notes here</li>
          <li>As stated in my HTML section a little worried about which branch this code is going on</li>
          <li>I am going to save this code and see if it refelcts on Live Server, I suppose that would mean I am on the main branch</li>
          <li>Yep, lol I saved and this code is live so I am not on the secondary branch and I am going to have to fix this, gg</li>
          <li>Additionally, git status: Checks what branch we are currently on git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and swithces to it</li>
          <li>Solution: I will save a copy of this version, and then try and see if I can switch branches and code on secondary branch and if that doesn't work will revert everything and try everything but keep this copy for my instructor on Nov. 6th</li>
